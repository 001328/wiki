In this series **azure deployments** we will deploy our infrastructure to azure.
The first step is to understand how a deployment works in general so we have a base to build upon.

I use github actions as it is pretty powerful and simple.



First, create a new repository.

Then create 3 Folders: **.github** | **templates** | **templates_custom**

{% highlight scss %}
